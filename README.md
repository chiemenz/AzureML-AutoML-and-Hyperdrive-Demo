# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
The Dataset seems to be based on the Kaggle Bank Marketing Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset

In total it contain data about bank customers (In total 21 columns) including the success of past marketing campaigns.

Numeric columns:
balance, day, age, duration, campaign, pdays, emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, euribor3m, nr.employed

Categorical columns:
month, dayofweek, default, job, loan, marital status, education, housing, contact, previous, poutcome

with a label column: success of marketing campaign (yes/no)

The goal of the Dataset is to predict the success of future marketing campaigns based on the outcomes of past marketing campaings
by taking into account the features of target customers. 

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model was a LightGBM (gradient boosting machine) with MaxAbsScaler preprocessing. 
It has an overall accuracy of 0.91596 and was found by using AutoML on the cleaned Dataset.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**



**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
